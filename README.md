# Chess Game

A **Java-based Chess Game** built as part of a programming project to simulate the classic game of chess. This repository contains all the source code needed to run a simple chess game following standard chess rules.

## 🧠 Overview

This project implements a chess game where:

* Two players can play against each other.
* Chess pieces move according to real rules.
* The game checks for legal moves and game progression.

The goal is to demonstrate object-oriented design and game logic implementation using Java.

## 🧩 Features

✔ Standard chess rules (piece movement, capturing) <br>
✔ Turn-based gameplay for two players <br>
✔ Console-based or basic GUI interface *(update this if GUI exists)* <br>
✔ Clear project structure and reusable code <br>

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
* A Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sathirapramudith123/Chess_Game-.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE.

3. Compile and run the main class (e.g., `Main.java` or similar).

## 🛠 How to Play

* Start the game by running the main program.
* Players enter moves via the console or by interacting with the board interface.
* Follow chess rules to move pieces and capture opponents.

*(If there’s a GUI, replace with instructions for clicking pieces.)*
